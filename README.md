- Sentiment analysis is the process of using natural language processing, text analysis, and statistics to analyze customer sentiment. The best businesses understand the sentiment of their customers — what people are saying, how they’re saying it, and what they mean. Customer sentiment can be found in tweets, comments, reviews, or other places where people mention your brand. Sentiment Analysis is the domain of understanding these emotions with software, and it’s a must-understand for developers and business leaders in a modern workplace.
- As with many other fields, advances in deep learning have brought sentiment analysis into the foreground of cutting-edge algorithms. Today we use natural language processing, statistics, and text analysis to extract, and identify the sentiment of words into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
